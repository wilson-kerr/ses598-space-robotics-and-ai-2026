In this assignment, you will understand the provided code in ROS2 with Turtlesim, and refactor and/or tune the navigator to implement a precise lawnmower survey (a boustrophedon pattern). The current code will do a pattern shown above, which is not a uniform lawnmower survey. 
Explore literature on how lawnmower surveys typically look, and modify the code to meet the requirements for a uniform survey. 

## Background
Boustrophedon patterns (from Greek: "ox-turning", like an ox drawing a plow) are fundamental coverage survey trajectories useful in space exploration and Earth observation. These patterns are useful for:

- **Space Exploration**: Rovers could use boustrophedon patterns to systematically survey areas of interest, ensuring complete coverage when searching for geological samples or mapping terrain. However, due to energy constraints, informative paths are usually optimized, and this results in paths that are sparser than complete coverage sampling, and may still produce high-accuracy reconstructions. 
  
- **Earth Observation**: Aerial vehicles employ these patterns for:
  - Agricultural monitoring and precision farming
  - Search and rescue operations
  - Environmental mapping and monitoring
  - Geological or archaeological surveys
  
- **Ocean Exploration**: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) use boustrophedon patterns to:
  - Map the ocean floor
  - Search for shipwrecks or aircraft debris
  - Monitor marine ecosystems
  
The efficiency and accuracy of these surveys depend heavily on the robot's ability to follow the prescribed path with minimal deviation (cross-track error). This assignment simulates these real-world challenges in a 2D environment using a first-order dynamical system (the turtlesim robot).

## Objective
Tune a PD controller to make a first-order system execute the most precise boustrophedon pattern possible. The goal is to minimize the cross-track error while maintaining smooth motion.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding PD control parameters and their effects on first-order systems
- Practical experience with controller tuning
- Analysis of trajectory tracking performance
- ROS2 visualization and debugging

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
Choose one of the following combinations:
- Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS2 Humble
- Ubuntu 23.04 + ROS2 Iron
- Ubuntu 23.10 + ROS2 Iron

### Required Packages
```bash
sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-turtlesim

## The Challenge

### 1. Controller Tuning (60 points)
Use rqt_reconfigure to tune the following PD controller parameters in real-time:
```python
# Controller parameters to tune
self.Kp_linear = 1.0   # Proportional gain for linear velocity
self.Kd_linear = 0.1   # Derivative gain for linear velocity
self.Kp_angular = 1.0  # Proportional gain for angular velocity
self.Kd_angular = 0.1  # Derivative gain for angular velocity
```

Performance Metrics:
- Average cross-track error (25 points)
- Maximum cross-track error (15 points)
- Smoothness of motion (10 points)
- Cornering performance (10 points)

### 2. Pattern Parameters (20 points)
Optimize the boustrophedon pattern parameters:
```python
# Pattern parameters to tune
self.spacing = 1.0     # Spacing between lines
```
- Coverage efficiency (10 points)
- Pattern completeness (10 points)

### 3. Analysis and Documentation (20 points)
Provide a detailed analysis of your tuning process:
- Methodology used for tuning
- Performance plots and metrics
- Challenges encountered and solutions
- Comparison of different parameter sets

## Tips for Success
- Start with low gains and increase gradually
- Test one parameter at a time
- Pay attention to both straight-line tracking and cornering
- Use rqt_plot to visualize performance in real-time
- Consider the trade-off between speed and accuracy

## Grading Rubric
- Perfect tracking (cross-track error < 0.2 units): 100%
- Good tracking (cross-track error < 0.5 units): 90%
