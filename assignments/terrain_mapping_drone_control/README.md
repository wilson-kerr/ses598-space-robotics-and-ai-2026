# Assignment 3: Rocky Times Challenge - Search, Map, & Analyze

This ROS2 package implements an autonomous drone system for geological feature detection, mapping, and analysis using an RGBD camera and PX4 SITL simulation.

## Challenge Overview

Students will develop a controller for a PX4-powered drone to efficiently search, map, and analyze 3D objects in an unknown environment. The drone must map the Perseverance rover, and land on it.

### Mission Objectives
Intermediate: 
1. Search and locate the cylinder
2. Map the cylinder in 3D
3. Land safely on top of the cylinder

Advanced (extra credit): 
Execute intermediate objective, and do the following additional tasks. 
1. Search and locate the rover
2. Map the rover in 3D
3. Land safely on top of the rover

In both cases, complete mission while logging time and energy performance. 

### Evaluation Criteria (100 points)

The assignment will be evaluated based on:
- Total time taken to complete the mission
- Total energy units consumed during operation
- Accuracy of rover 3D model
- Landing precision on rover
- Performance across 3 trials

### Key Requirements

- Autonomous takeoff and search strategy implementation
- Real-time rover detection 
- Energy-conscious path planning for mapping using SLAM 
- Safe and precise landing on the rover once mapping is complete
- Robust performance across trials

## Prerequisites

- ROS2 Humble
- PX4 SITL Simulator (Tested with PX4-Autopilot main branch 9ac03f03eb)
- RTAB-Map ROS2 package
- OpenCV
- Python 3.8+

## Repository Setup

### If you already have a fork of the course repository:

```bash
# Navigate to your local copy of the repository
cd ~/RAS-SES-598-Space-Robotics-and-AI

# Add the original repository as upstream (if not already done)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/DREAMS-lab/RAS-SES-598-Space-Robotics-and-AI.git

# Fetch the latest changes from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Checkout your main branch
git checkout main

# Merge upstream changes
git merge upstream/main

# Push the updates to your fork
git push origin main
```

### If you don't have a fork yet:

1. Fork the course repository:
   - Visit: https://github.com/DREAMS-lab/RAS-SES-598-Space-Robotics-and-AI
   - Click "Fork" in the top-right corner
   - Select your GitHub account as the destination

2. Clone your fork:
```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/RAS-SES-598-Space-Robotics-and-AI.git
```

### Create Symlink to ROS2 Workspace

```bash
# Create symlink in your ROS2 workspace
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
ln -s ~/RAS-SES-598-Space-Robotics-and-AI/assignments/terrain_mapping_drone_control .
```

### Copy PX4 Model Files

Copy the custom PX4 model files to the PX4-Autopilot folder

```bash
# Navigate to the package
cd ~/ros2_ws/src/terrain_mapping_drone_control

# Make the setup script executable
chmod +x scripts/deploy_px4_model.sh

# Run the setup script to copy model files
./scripts/deploy_px4_model.sh -p /path/to/PX4-Autopilot
```

## Building and Running

```bash
# Build the package
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select terrain_mapping_drone_control --symlink-install

# Source the workspace
source install/setup.bash

# Launch the simulation with visualization with your PX4-Autopilot path
ros2 launch terrain_mapping_drone_control cylinder_landing.launch.py

# OR you can change the default path in the launch file
        DeclareLaunchArgument(
            'px4_autopilot_path',
            default_value=os.environ.get('HOME', '/home/' + os.environ.get('USER', 'user')) + '/PX4-Autopilot',
            description='Path to PX4-Autopilot directory'),
```
## Extra credit -- 3D reconstruction (50 points)
Use RTAB-Map or a SLAM ecosystem of your choice to map both rocks, and export the world as a mesh file, and upload to your repo. Use git large file system (LFS) if needed.
